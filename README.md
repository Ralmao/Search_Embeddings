# Search_Embeddings
NLP search embeddings are a way of representing text data in a way that makes it easier for computers to understand and compare. They are created by training a neural network on a large corpus of text data. The neural network learns to represent each word or phrase as a vector of numbers, where similar words or phrases have similar vectors.
